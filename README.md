🔐 Encrypted Chat Application (AES)

A secure client–server chat application built using Python as part of the SYNTECXHUB 4-Week Virtual Cyber Security Internship.
All messages are encrypted using AES symmetric encryption before transmission.

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how secure communication can be implemented over TCP sockets using AES encryption, random IVs, and multithreading.
The server supports multiple clients simultaneously and logs only encrypted messages, ensuring confidentiality.

🚀 Features

TCP socket-based client–server communication
AES (CBC mode) encryption for messages
Random IV generated for every message
Pre-shared symmetric key handling
Supports multiple clients (threading)
Encrypted message logging
Works on Windows (PowerShell / CMD)

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3.x
socket – networking
threading – concurrency
logging – message logging
cryptography – AES encryption

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Install Python

Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed:
python --version
2️⃣ Install Required Library

python -m pip install cryptography

▶️ How to Run
Step 1: Start the Server
Open PowerShell / Command Prompt:

python "Encrypted Chat App.py"
When prompted:

Enter mode (server/client): server
You should see:

Server listening on 127.0.0.1:5000

Step 2: Start Clients (in new terminals)
Open another PowerShell window and run:

python "Encrypted Chat App.py"
Choose:

Enter mode (server/client): client
Repeat this step to connect multiple clients.

Step 3: Chat Securely
Type messages in any client:

You: hello
Messages will be:

Encrypted during transmission
Decrypted only at the client
Logged as ciphertext in chat.log

🔒 Security Implementation

AES-256 (CBC mode) used for encryption
Random IV per message prevents pattern attacks
PKCS7 padding ensures block alignment
Encrypted logs only (no plaintext stored)
Example log entry:

Encrypted message from ('127.0.0.1', 52522):
8c564196f259c61f79db0ccdcbb363f8...

⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is developed strictly for educational and internship purposes.
Do not use this application for real-world secure communication without implementing:
Secure key exchange (e.g., Diffie-Hellman)
Authentication
TLS/SSL

📈 Future Enhancements

Secure key exchange (Diffie-Hellman)
User authentication
TLS integration
GUI-based client
Message integrity (HMAC)
